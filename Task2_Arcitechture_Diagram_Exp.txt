Here's a detailed explanation for Task 2 GCP Architecture Workflow, using the diagram as reference:

1. Cloud Scheduler
- What it does: Initiates the pipeline daily (e.g., at midnight).
- Why it's used: Automates the trigger of data ingestion without manual effort.

2. Cloud Function
- Triggered by: Cloud Scheduler.
- Performs two main tasks:
  1. Reads Kaggle API credentials securely from Secret Manager 
     and then fetches data from Kaggle using the API 
	 and stores raw `.csv` files in Cloud Storage.
  3. Then triggers Cloud Composer to initiate the ETL workflow.

3. Secret Manager
- What it does: Securely stores Kaggle API credentials.
- Why it's used: Prevents hardcoding sensitive info in the code and enables role-based access.

4. Cloud Storage
- Purpose: Holds raw CSV files from Kaggle.
- Why it's used:
  - Durable and cost-effective storage.
  - Easy integration with GCP services like Dataflow and Cloud Composer.

5. Cloud Composer (Airflow DAG)
- Triggered by: Cloud Function after data fetch is complete.
- DAG Workflow Includes:
  1. Reads raw CSVs from Cloud Storage.
  2. Cleans & transforms the data (applies business rules like `radio_mix`, `popularity > 50`, `explicit == False`).
  3. Loads final dataset into BigQuery.

6. BigQuery
- Receives: Transformed data from Airflow DAG.
- Purpose:
  1. Acts as a data warehouse.
  2. Enables creation of views for business-specific aggregations or summaries.
  3. Fast SQL-based analytics.

7. Looker Studio
- Connects to: BigQuery views.
- Delivers: Visual dashboards (e.g., Top Labels, Popular Tracks).
- Why it's used: Easy drag-and-drop UI, integrates natively with BigQuery for real-time BI.

8. Monitoring & Alerting
- Monitors:
  - Cloud Scheduler
  - Cloud Function
  - Composer DAG
  - BigQuery load status
- Alerts:
  - Send notifications (email/Slack) on failures or latency breaches.



 Benefits of Using Specific GCP Components

  Component          | Reason & Benefits                                                                 
 ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 Cloud Scheduler     | Cron-like automation, serverless, low-maintenance.                                    
 Cloud Function      | Lightweight, scalable function to handle API calls and downstream triggers.           
 Secret Manager      | Keeps credentials secure, audit-logged, and accessible only to authorized identities. 
 Cloud Storage       | Durable, scalable, integrates with Dataflow, Composer, BigQuery easily.               
 Cloud Composer      | Managed Airflow service, allows complex ETL orchestration with retries & visibility.  
 BigQuery            | Serverless, highly-performant SQL data warehouse with automatic scaling.              
 Looker Studio       | Interactive dashboarding, directly on BigQuery without exporting data.                
 Monitoring & Alerts | Ensures SLA, catches failures early, keeps system reliable.
